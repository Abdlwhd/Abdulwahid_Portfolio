This portfolio contains various data science projects.
# Project 1: Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease by Integrating Machine and Manifold Learning Models
* Built a framework for diagnosis Azlheimer's disease using MRI features
* Performed Exploratory Analysis to gain useful insights about the data
* Applied preprocessing techniques to clean and transfrom the data
* Utilized a manifold learning approach (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
* Used a regression model to verify feature importance
* Optimized SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Naive bayes and Decision Tree classifier to find the best model
* Evaluated the machine learning models using ROC analysis and confusion matrix
